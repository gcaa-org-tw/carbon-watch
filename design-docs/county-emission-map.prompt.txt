Add 排碳縣市分佈 hero section. Make it as component & sub component, if necessary for modulization & readability.

- title: 排碳縣市分佈
- the main content show a Taiwan map + per county carbon emission info card
- the map is tw-counties.json, a topo json, which can be zoom & pan
   - for zoom, we need to zoom into county level programmatically
   - for zoom & pan, it will require 2 finger to trigger in mobile device, so to avoid confusion between page scroll and map pan
  - note that 
   - find proper library to support above functionality
- the per county emission card use `region-emission-list.json`, which is already ordered by emission

## Overall layout for phone version

1. For phone version, the secion is 90vh height
2. below title, map take the remaining space
   a. user can pan/zoom the map using 2 fingers
3. Use full width horizontal carousel to show list of county emission, each card width should take 70vw, so we can see next card a little bit
   a. On new card shows up, zoom the map to corresponding county on map w/ animation, highlight the county, user should still see other counties around.
4. On click on the card, jump to `/companies[/pro]?region=<target county>

## Overall layout for tablet and wider screen

1. the secion is 90vh height
2. below title, use 2 columns to display map (left) and the county list (right)
   a. zoom/pan the map is not allowed, always show entire Taiwan map
   b. On hover the county card, highlight the county on the map
   c. the height of county list is the same as the map, use scroll bar if overflow
   c. On click the count on the map, scroll corresponding card into view
4. On click on the card, jump to `/companies[/pro]?region=<target county>
